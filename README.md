Genetic Algorithm Fish Tank
========

Watch fish develop a streamlined shape, diet, and even behavior as they compete for survival in a virtual fish tank!

I'm working on this in part to explore new Javascript libraries: in this case, EaselJS. It might never get all the way done.

Getting Started
====

1. Install Node
2. npm install
3. bower install

To develop, just run "grunt watch" and open the app in your browser. You should be all set!
